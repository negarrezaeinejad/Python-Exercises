# Nth-Root of a Complex Number Calculator

## Description

This Python code calculates the nth root of a complex number in the form of `a + bi`.

## Requirements

This code requires Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `nth_root.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the `nth_root.py` file is located.
3. Run the command `python nth_root.py` to execute the code.
4. Enter the real and imaginary parts of the complex number when prompted.
5. Enter the desired root value when prompted.
6. The code will output the nth roots of the complex number in the form of `root n = a + bi`.

## Example

```
pythonCopy code
please enter the real part: 1
please enter the imaginary part: 0
please enter your desired root: 2
root 0 = (1+0j)
root 1 = (-1+1.2246467991473532e-16j)

please enter the real part: 1
please enter the imaginary part: 0
please enter your desired root: 3
root 0 = (1+0j)
root 1 = (-0.4999999999999998+0.8660254037844387j)
root 2 = (-0.5000000000000004-0.8660254037844385j)
```

In the above example, the user first entered a real number of 1 and an imaginary number of 0, followed by a desired root value of 2. The output displays the two nth roots of the complex number. The second example shows the output for a root value of 3.
