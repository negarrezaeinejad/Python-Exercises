# ZIP Code Validator

This is a simple Python code that validates a ZIP code.

## Installation

This code does not require any external library, and can be executed using Python 3.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code file.
2. Run the code by typing:

```python
python validate_zip_code.py
```

1. The code will prompt you to enter the ZIP code. Enter the ZIP code and press Enter.
2. The code will validate the ZIP code, and display a message indicating whether it is valid or not.

## Example

For example, let's say you want to validate the ZIP code "12345". You would run the code and enter "12345" at the prompt. The output would be:

```python
Please Enter Your Zip Code: 12345
12345 is a valid Zip Code!
```

If you enter an invalid ZIP code, the output will be:

```python
Please Enter Your Zip Code: abcde
abcde is not a valid Zip Code!
```

You can also redirect the output to a file using the following command:

```python
python validate_zip_code.py > output.txt
```

This will save the output to a file called "output.txt".
