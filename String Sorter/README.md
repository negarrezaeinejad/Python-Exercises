# String Sorter

This Python code takes an input string from the user and sorts it in alphabetical order. It defines a function `sortstr(string)` which takes a string and returns a sorted version of it. The sorted string is generated by first converting the string to a list using the `sorted()` function, which sorts the characters in the string in ascending order. Then the sorted list is joined back into a string using the `join()` function. The sorted string is returned by the function.

## Example

```python
Please enter a string: Hello world!
 !Hdellloorw
```

In this example, the input string is "Hello world!", and the output is "!Hdellloorw" which is the sorted version of the input string with the spaces and punctuation at the beginning.

```python
Please enter a string: I'm 22 years old.
   '.22Iadelmorsy
```

In this example, the input string is "I'm 22 years old.", and the output is " '.22Iadelmorsy" which is the sorted version of the input string with spaces and punctuation characters at the beginning.
