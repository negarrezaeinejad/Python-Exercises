# Area And Circumference Of A Circle Calculator

This is a simple Python code that calculates the area and circumference of a circle based on its radius.

## Installation

This code does not require any external library, and can be executed using Python 3.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code file.
2. Run the code by typing:

```python
python circle_calculation.py
```

1. The code will prompt you to enter the radius of the circle. Enter the radius and press Enter.
2. The code will calculate the area and circumference of the circle, and display the results in the terminal.

## Example

For example, let's say you want to calculate the area and circumference of a circle with a radius of 7. You would run the code and enter 7 at the prompt. The output would be:

```python
Plesase enter your desired Radius: 7
Area of a circle with radius of  7  is  153.93804002589985
Circumference of a circle with radius of  7  is  43.982297150257104
```

You can also redirect the output to a file using the following command:

```python
python circle_calculation.py > output.txt
```

This will save the output to a file called "output.txt".
