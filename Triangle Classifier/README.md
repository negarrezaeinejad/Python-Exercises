# Triangle Classifier

This Python code reads in three points in the (x,y) plane and determines if they form a triangle. If so, it classifies the triangle as equilateral, right-angled and isosceles, isosceles, or scalene.

## Example

Here's an example of running the code and printing the result:

```python
Enter the 1st point:1,0
Enter the 2nd point:math.cos(2*math.pi/3),math.sin(2*math.pi/3)
Enter the 3rd point:math.cos(4*math.pi/3),math.sin(4*math.pi/3)
three points construct an equilateral triangle.

Enter the 1st point:1,0
Enter the 2nd point:0,1
Enter the 3rd point:0,0
three points construct a right-angled and isosceles triangle.

Enter the 1st point:1,0
Enter the 2nd point:-1,0
Enter the 3rd point:0,30
three points construct an isosceles triangle.
